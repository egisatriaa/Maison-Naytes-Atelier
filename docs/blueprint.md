## Style Guidelines:

- Primary typography color: Soft white (#E6E6E6) for maximum legibility and elegance against dark backgrounds.
- Default background color: Deep charcoal (#131315) to establish a dark, cinematic, and luxurious aesthetic.
- General accent color: A subtle, refined gold (#D1AA5B) for universal highlights, complementing the dynamic variant-specific accent colors (crimson, ocean blue, amber).
- Light mode color scheme: Soft ivory background with dark typography and champagne gold accents, providing an alternative elegant experience.
- Headline and main title font: 'Playfair' (serif), chosen for its modern, high-contrast, Didot-like aesthetic, conveying a luxurious and editorial feel.
- Body and descriptive text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), providing a clean, objective, and highly readable complement to the serif headlines for all explanatory content.
- Use minimal, monochrome line-based icons for social media and subtle UI elements, maintaining an understated and elegant brand image. Loaders should also be clean and minimal.
- Full-screen hero with left-aligned text, a clear central focus for the perfume bottle, and a subtle vertical navigation strip on the right, promoting an uncluttered visual hierarchy.
- Implement a sticky top navigation bar and well-defined, spaced-out content sections below the hero to maintain a clean single-page layout without overwhelming the user.
- Core animation features include scroll-driven WebP parallax, smooth fade transitions for text and accent colors on fragrance changes, and subtle loaders to enhance the cinematic feel.
